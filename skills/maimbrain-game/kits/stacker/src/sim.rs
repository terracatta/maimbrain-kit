//! The rules and the physics: a bird flies back and forth over a plate on a
//! pole, carrying a snack; a tap lets go. Whatever comes to rest on the
//! tower counts, whatever falls off costs a heart. Later the wind gusts and
//! the plate tilts. Pure game state: input arrives as calls (`drop_piece`),
//! sounds, haptics and juice leave as `cues`; nothing here draws or plays.
//!
//! Everything is a real rigid body (`maimbrain::physics2d`, docs/PHYSICS.md):
//! how a snack lands, wobbles, wedges or slides is never scripted.
