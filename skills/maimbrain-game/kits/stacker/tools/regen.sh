# Regenerates every picture and sound in this game with `mb art`, `mb music`
# and `mb sfx`, in the style of art/style.toml, then packs and quantizes them.
# To restyle the game: edit art/style.toml (style, palette, [music], [sfx]),
# edit the prompts below (they name the snacks, the bird and the meadow), and
# run it. Needs `mb` with a Gemini key (images, music) and an ElevenLabs key
# (effects); vorbis-tools (oggenc/oggdec) and python3 for the last steps.
#
#   tools/regen.sh all       # everything: ~$1.05 (27 images, 2 tracks, 15 effects)
#   tools/regen.sh snacks    # or one group: snacks, bird, faces, scene, icon, music, sfx
#   tools/regen.sh pack      # only re-pack art/sprites/*.png into assets/ (free)
#
# Look at every art/preview/*.png it prints, regenerate what's off with
# `mb regen art/sprites/<name>.png --new-seed` (or edit its prompt here), then
# `tools/regen.sh pack`. Snack pictures are stretched over their colliders
# (`Kind::size()` in src/sim.rs), so each must fill its box the way the
# collider does: toast a 3:2 rectangle, jelly a square, the baguette a long
# rounded bar, cheese a trapezoid (top 46 % of the bottom), the macaron a
# rounded rectangle, the tomato a circle. Say the shape and proportions in the
# prompt, and "nothing peeks out behind it" (models like to add a dark backing
# layer). If the art's shape differs, change the collider to match the art
# (`Kind::wedge_points`, `Kind::radius`) rather than leave them dishonest.
