# IS. To restyle the kit: edit art/style.toml (style, palette, [music]

# Sprite sources live in art/sprites/ (their .gen.json sidecars are kept in
# git, the PNGs aren't: they're packed into the atlas). `atlas` first restores
# any missing source PNG from the current atlas, so regenerating one sprite
# keeps the others. After regenerating a sprite with a face window, run
# tools/measure_faces.sh and update the offsets at the top of src/draw.rs.
#
# Needs: mb (or MB="cargo run -q -p mb-cli --"), python3 with Pillow for the
# atlas quantize step, ImageMagick (`magick`) to restore sprites from the atlas,
# numpy and oggenc/oggdec (vorbis-tools) for the effects.
